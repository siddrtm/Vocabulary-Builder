The main hurdle that I faced when trying to build vocabulary for exams like GRE was that the revision schedule would be very poor and because of that I could not retain most of the words that I learnt. 
This piece of script was built by me to solve this problem of mine by having words that I learnt pop up after predefined time in flash card manner while I am using my computer, so that I wouldn't have to explicitly revise the words that I learnt.


To run app use 
>>>python vocabbuilder.py

Make sure vocabbuilder.py and wordlist.xls are in same folder.

You can use any worldist in similar format.

For installing pip and other dependencies use:  
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-easygui python-tk python-xlrd
sudo pip install pyttsx
